## Conclusions

In this section we have explored generic types and functions, which allow us to abstract over types and methods respectively. Using these building blocks we have seen some common patterns for working with generic types, namely *fold*, *map*, and *flatMap*.

In the next section we will explore these topics further by working with the collections classes in Scala.
