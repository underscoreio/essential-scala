# Thanks

A big thanks to Richard Dallway and Jonathon Ferguson, who helped develop the rendering pipeline that produces the finished book and also took on the herculean task of proof reading our early drafts.

Thanks also to Jason Scott, Daniel Watford, and Audrey Welsh who sent us corrections and suggestions. Knowing that our work was being read and used made the long haul of writing the book worthwhile.
