## Compound Expressions

We have almost finished our basic introduction to Scala. In this section we are going to look at two special kinds of expressions, _conditionals_ and _blocks_, we will need in more complicated programs.

### Conditionals

A conditional allows us to choose an expression to evaluate based on some condition. For example, we can choose a string based on which of two numbers is the smallest.

```scala mdoc
if(1 < 2) "Yes" else "No"
```

<div class="callout callout-info">
#### Conditionals are Expressions {-}

Scala's `if` statement has the same syntax as Java's. One important difference is that _Scala's conditional is an expression_---it has a type and returns a value.

</div>

The expression that is not selected does not get evaluated. This is apparent if we use an expression with a side-effect.

```scala mdoc
if(1 < 2) println("Yes") else println("No")
```

We can tell the expression `println("No")` is not evaluated because `No` is not output to the console.

<div class="callout callout-info">
#### Conditional Expression Syntax {-}

The syntax for a conditional expression is

```scala
if(condition)
  trueExpression
else
  falseExpression
```

where

- `condition` is an expression with `Boolean` type;
- `trueExpression` is the expression evaluated if `condition` evaluates to `true`; and
- `falseExpression` is the expression evaluated if `condition` evaluates to `false`.
</div>

### Blocks

Blocks are expressions that allow us to sequence computations together. They are written as a pair of braces containing sub-expressions separated by semicolons or newlines.

```scala mdoc:fail
{ 1; 2; 3 }
```

As you can see, executing this code causes the console to raise a number of warnings and return the `Int` value `3`.

A block is a sequence of expressions or declarations surrounded by braces. A block is also an expression: it executes each of its sub-expressions in order and returns the value of the last expression.

Why execute `1` and `2` if we're going to throw their values away? This is a good question, and is the reason the Scala compiler raised those warnings above.

One reason to use a block is to use code that produces side-effects before calculating a final value:

```scala mdoc
{
  println("This is a side-effect")
  println("This is a side-effect as well")
  3
}
```

We can also use a block when we want to name intermediate results, such as

```scala mdoc:silent
def name: String = {
  val title = "Professor"
  val name = "Funkenstein"
  title + " " + name
}
```

```scala mdoc
name
```

<div class="callout callout-info">

#### Block Expression Syntax {-}

The syntax of a block expression is

```scala
{
   declarationOrExpression ...
   expression
}
```

where

- the optional `declarationOrExpression`s are declarations or expression; and
- `expression` is an expression determining the type and value of the block expression.
</div>

### Take home points

Conditional expressions allow us to choose an expression to evaluate based on a `Boolean` condition. The syntax is

```scala
if(condition)
  trueExpression
else
  falseExpression
```

A conditional, being an expression, has a type and evaluates to an object.

A block allows us to sequence expressions and declarations. It is commonly used when we want to sequence expressions with side-effects, or name intermediate results in a computation. The syntax is

```scala
{
   declarationOrExpression ...
   expression
}
```

The type and value of a block is that of the last expression in the block.

### Exercises

#### A Classic Rivalry

What is the type and value of the following conditional?

```scala mdoc:silent
if(1 > 2) "alien" else "predator"
```

<div class="solution">
It's a `String` with value `"predator"`. Predators are clearly best:

```scala mdoc
if(1 > 2) "alien" else "predator"
```

The type is determined by the upper bound of the types in the _then_ and _else_ expressions. In this case both expressions are `Strings` so the result is also a `String`.

The value is determined at runtime. `2` is greater than `1` so the conditional evaluates to the value of the _else_ expression.

</div>

#### A Less Well Known Rivalry

What about this conditional?

```scala mdoc:silent
if(1 > 2) "alien" else 2001
```

<div class="solution">
It's a value of type `Any` with value `2001`:

```scala mdoc
if(1 > 2) "alien" else 2001
```

This is similar to the previous exercise---the difference is the type of the result. We saw earlier that the type is the _upper bound_ of the positive and negative arms of the expression. `"alien"` and `2001` are completely different types - their closest common ancestor is `Any`, which is the grand supertype of all Scala types.

This is an important observation: types are determined at compile time, before the program is run. The compiler doesn't know which of `1` and `2` is greater before running the program, so it can only make a best guess at the type of the result of the conditional. `Any` is as close as it can get in this program, whereas in the previous exercise it can get all the way down to `String`.

We'll learn more about `Any` in the following sections. Java programmers shouldn't confuse it with `Object` because it subsumes value types like `Int` and `Boolean` as well.

</div>

#### An if Without an else

What about this conditional?

```scala mdoc:silent
if(false) "hello"
```

<div class="solution">
The result type and value are `Any` and `()` respectively:

```scala mdoc
if(false) "hello"
```

All code being equal, conditionals without `else` expressions only evaluate to a value half of the time. Scala works around this by returning the `Unit` value if the `else` branch should be evaluated. We would usually only use these expressions for their side-effects.
