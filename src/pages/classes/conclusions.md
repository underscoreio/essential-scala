title: Conclusions

In this section we've explored **classes**. We have seen that classes allow us to abstract over objects. That is, to define objects that share properties in common and have a common type.

We also looked at **companion objects**, which are used in Scala to define auxillary constructors and other utility methods that don't belong on a class.

Finally, we introduced **case classes**, which greatly reduce boilerplate code and allow **pattern-matching**, a new way of interacting with objects, in addition to method calls.
