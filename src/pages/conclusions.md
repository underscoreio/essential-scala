# Conclusions

This completes Essential Scala. To recap our journey, we have learned Scala via the major patterns of usage:

- algebraic data types and structural recursion;
- sequencing computations using `map`, `flatMap`, and `fold`; and
- type classes.

These are the patterns we use daily in our Scala coding, which we have found work well across many Scala projects, and they make up by the far the majority of our Scala code. They will serve you well.

We have tried to emphasise that if you can model the problem correctly the code follows in an almost mechanical way. Learning how to think in the Scala way (or, more broadly, in a functional way) is by far the most important lesson of this book.

We have introduced language features as they support the patterns. In the appendices you will find additional material covering some inessential functionality we have skipped over in the main text. Scala has a few other features, such as self types, that we have found so little use for in our years of programming Scala that we have omitted them entirely in this introductory text.

## What Now?

The journey to mastering Scala has not finished with this book. You will benefit greatly from active participation in the Scala community. We have setup an [online chat room](http://gitter.im/underscoreio/scala) for discussion of all Scala related matters. Any and all Scala related questions are welcome there. There are many other forums, conferences, and user groups where you can find an enthusiastic and welcoming community of fellow programmers.

If you have enjoyed Essential Scala we hope you'll consider our followup book [Advanced Scala](http://underscore.io/training/courses/advanced-scala). As the name suggests, it covers more advanced concepts with an emphasis on patterns for larger programs.

Finally, we would love hear your thoughts on Essential Scala. Any feedback---good or bad---helps to improve the book. We can be reached at [hello@underscore.io](mailto:hello@underscore.io). Any improvements we make to Essential Scala will of course be made available to every reader as part of our policy of free lifetime updates.

Thank you for reading Essential Scala, and we hope you future coding in Scala is productive and fun.
